By letting algorithms make decisions for us, we risk losing touch with our own creative instincts and intuition. We may start to rely too heavily on pre-set filters and effects, rather than taking the time to experiment and discover our own unique style. Moreover, the ease of use and accessibility of AI-powered photo curation tools may lead to a homogenization of visual aesthetics, as everyone begins to use the same filters and effects",
