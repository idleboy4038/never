# URL parameters

URL parameters are a way to pass data within the URL itself. Here are a few examples of how you can use URL parameters:

1. Basic Parameter:
   - Pass a single parameter in the URL to customize the content or behavior of a page.

   ```arduino
   https://example.com/page?parameter=value
   ```

   In this example, `parameter` is the name of the parameter, and `value` is the value you want to pass. The page can then read the value of the parameter and adjust its content or behavior accordingly.

2. Multiple Parameters:
   - Pass multiple parameters in the URL to provide more specific information or customization options.

   ```arduino
   https://example.com/page?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3
   ```

   In this example, multiple parameters (`param1`, `param2`, `param3`) are passed with their corresponding values. The receiving page can access and utilize these parameters to tailor its functionality accordingly.

3. Filtering and Sorting:
   - Use URL parameters to filter or sort content on a page.

   ```bash
   https://example.com/products?category=electronics&sort=price_asc
   ```

   In this example, the URL is used to filter products by the `category` of "electronics" and sort them in ascending order of `price`. The page can then retrieve and apply these filters and sorting options to display the relevant content.

4. Pagination:
   - Implement pagination using URL parameters to navigate through different pages of content.

   ```arduino
   https://example.com/products?page=2
   ```

   In this example, the URL parameter `page` is used to specify the page number of the products. By changing the value of the `page` parameter, users can navigate to different pages of the product listing.

5. Search Queries:
   - Pass search queries as URL parameters to pre-populate search fields or perform specific searches.

   ```arduino
   https://example.com/search?query=keyword
   ```

   In this example, the URL parameter `query` is used to pass a search keyword. The search page can use this parameter to automatically populate the search field or initiate a search for the provided keyword.

These examples demonstrate how URL parameters can be used to enhance the functionality and customization options of a website. The exact implementation and handling of URL parameters depend on the server-side language or JavaScript framework you are using to process the incoming requests.
